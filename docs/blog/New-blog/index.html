<p>As you can imagine, I have got tired of writing articles and then posting them to my <a href="https://github.com/sinlerdev/write-ups">write-ups'</a> github repository. This is expected, as the process is very tedious, since this usually requires me manually translating whatever I wrote on the original platform to a github-friendly format.</p>
<p>Of course, using Twitter won't solve this, as Twitter wasn't designed for this kind of usage unless of course I am planning to give some money to Musk.</p>
<p>This website is a solution I came up with to post educational particles, software researches, and any random stuff I will ever write.</p>
<p>This website was built with <a href="https://github.com/sunainapai/makesite/tree/master">makesite.py</a> with some modification applied.</p>
