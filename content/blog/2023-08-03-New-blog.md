<!-- title: I am a blog writer now-->
As you can imagine, I have got tired of writing articles and then posting them to my [write-ups'](https://github.com/sinlerdev/write-ups) github repository. This is expected, as the process is very tedious, since this usually requires me manually translating whatever I wrote on the original platform to a github-friendly format.

Of course, using Twitter won't solve this, as Twitter wasn't designed for this kind of usage unless of course I am planning to give some money to Musk.

This website is a solution I came up with to post educational particles, software researches, and any random stuff I will ever write.

This website was built with [makesite.py](https://github.com/sunainapai/makesite/tree/master) with some modification applied.
